# The Effects of Economic Sanctions on Inflation Rates
## Project Overview
For this project, I will analyze economic metrics data from Russia and Syria, two countries that are under economic sanctions. Sanctions and embargoes are financial penalties applied by different international powers for different reasons; in these cases, they are applied due to violation of international law.

I will be looking at data on the Inflation Rate (CPI), poverty index, unemployment rate, currency exchange rates, and balance of trade. By analyzing this data and highliting the changes of these metrics before and after the imposition of sanctions. Moreover, I hope to analyze the countries' efforts to curb the effects of sanctions and how effective these efforts have been.


## Objectives
### 1. Understand how sanctions affect sanctioned countries
Examine effects on both the country's economy and people's livelihoods.

### 2. Obtain data-driven conclusions on the effectiveness of sanctions
Explore whether sanctions forced sanctioned governments to stop their violations.

### 3. Highlight the disadvantages of sanctions as a policy
Sanctions aggravate economic crises in sanctioned countries.

## Motivation
I'm interested in applying computer science in the field of international relations and this topic is particularly interesting to me since I grew up in a country under sanctions, Syria, and I experienced the effects of sanctions first-hand.

## Datasets
- **Inflation rates:** Statburreau for Russia, Central Bureau of Statistics for Syria.
- **Exchange Rate:** International Monetary Fund Data Portal, for both countries.
- **Poverty Rate**: Russian Federal State Statistics Service for Russia, UNDP for Syria
- **Unemployment rate:**  Russian Federal State Statistics Service for Russia, World Bank and CEIC Syria.
